<p><strong>NOTE</strong>:</p>
<p>1. It seems like it is possible to make <code>q3_run.py</code> run about twice as fast by passing gradOut of skipgram to the negSamplingCostAndGradient q3_word2vec.py in instead of recreating them at every iteration of the context words. This is implemented in q3_word2vec_fast.py</p>
<p>2. In question 3, the results using the code in this repo are different than the official solution. A number of other githubers get the same result (<a href="https://github.com/Twice22/CS224n-solutions/blob/master/Assigment%201/assignment1/q3_word_vectors.png">Twice22</a>, <a href="https://github.com/izarov/cs224n/blob/master/assignment1/q3_word_vectors.png">izarov</a> ), but others get different one (<a href="https://github.com/kvfrans/cs224-solutions/blob/master/a1/q3_word_vectors.png">kvfrans</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kingtaurus/cs224d/blob/master/assignment1/q3_word_vectors.png">kingtaurus</a>). The results obtained using the code in this repo are similar to those of <a href="https://github.com/yasiemir/cs224n/blob/master/assignment1/q3_word_vectors.png">yasiemir</a>.</p>
<p>Since, at least for the spring 2017 version the same seeds are used, it is not clear yet why the results differ. In any case, the accuracies attained in q4 with the coefficients obtained using this code are reasonable (~30% when the GloVe pretrained coefficient yield about 37%).</p>
<p>3. The original link given to download the pretrained weights for question 4 in the original get_datasets.sh file is broken.</p>
<p>At this time is seems like this link works: https://github.com/nate-parrott/squad/raw/master/data/glove.6B.50d.txt.zip</p>
<p>The get get_datasets.sh file of this repository has been modified accordingly.</p>
