NOTE: 

The original link given to download the pretrained weights for question 4 in the original get_datasets.sh file is broken.

At this time is seems like this link works: https://github.com/nate-parrott/squad/raw/master/data/glove.6B.50d.txt.zip

The get get_datasets.sh file of this repository has been modified accordingly.
